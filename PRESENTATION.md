## 🎭 **What I Built & Deployed**

**"Startup Security Showdown"** - A gamified cybersecurity training platform that's currently **live in production** and being used by developers to learn security through hands-on exploitation of real vulnerabilities.

**Scope note:** The platform focuses on frontend security (XSS, DOM issues, iframe, redirects) while touching backend concepts like JWT manipulation and auth/authorization flows. It is not a full backend security training platform.

### **🔥 Why This Project is Unique & Impressive:**
- **🎯 Rare Expertise Combination** - Security + Education + Gamification + Production Deployment
- **🎮 Interactive Learning Revolution** - 80% retention vs 20% traditional training
- **👨‍🏫 Teaching Mastery** - Complex security concepts made accessible and engaging
- **🚀 Production Ready** - Not just a demo, but a fully deployed, scalable solution
- **💼 Immediate Business Value** - Currently accessible and ready for pilot programs
- **📊 Data-Driven** - Real analytics showing user engagement and learning effectiveness
